	<p> Genealogy is the study of family,origins and history. It is  an account of the descent of a person, family, or group from an ancestor or from older forms such as census records.
	    Genealogists compile lists of ancestors,which they arrange in pedigree of charts or other written forms.However, it has continuously been of interest and importance to people for hundreds of years. 
	    Those of noble birth in the European courts especially needed to know their lineage to determine who was actually in line for the crown</p>
	<p>The term ‘Genealogy’ is the study of family ancestors with documentation of birth, marriage and death dates through parents, grandparents, great grandparents, as far back as possible. Whereas, ‘family history’ is more an in-depth study of the lineage in a family including the life 
	   stories of individuals; like their education, occupations, medical conditions, military service, residences, etc.</p>
	<p>In todays world there are now tools available to look at census records,birth and death records and marriage records,etc.Please feel free to look at my other links to learn about the various resources are available.</p>
	<p>There are a few different types of Genealogy that you can have deeper look into.<b>Ascending Genealogy-</b> The idea of ascending Genealogy is that it is designed to search for and look into the ancestors of a person.
	   <b>Descending Genealogy</b>- This form of Genealogy will look at the descendants of a person.Estate Genealogy- This particular form of Genealogy will need to be carried out by a professional in the field and is usually at the request of someone who is a notary during a succession.
	   <b>Agnatic Genealogy-</b> This type of Genealogy will look at the male Ancestry of a person.
	   <b>Cognitive Genealogy-</b> If you carry out this particular Genealogy then it will look at both ascendants and descendants even if they do not have the same name.</p>
	<p> According to recent figures 26 million people have taken an at home Ancestry tests i.e.DNA Tests.One of the best things about Genealogy is that it can show you a part of your history, a part of your life that you never even thought that you might be able to learn about.
	You might not know some members of your extended family, or you might have been adopted, something that Genealogy is going to be able to help you with.</p>
