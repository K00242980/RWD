    <h2>Starting Your Family History</h2>
	<img src="Feature 2 Image.jpg" alt="f1" id="f1"></a>
	<p>Author: K00242980  Date:7th November 2019</p>
	<p>I know there are many ways to start looking into your family history,but sometimes its very hard to know where to start.Here are some of my tips and tricks of how to know where
	to start.Some of the starting points are <b>Talk to your family,Surnames And Naming,Dates,Record Everything.</b>I will elaborate on these later.
	There are so many different ways to start looking but I think these main points are the most important and are a good way to start.
	<p><b>Talk to your family:</b>So first, talk to parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents etc., and find out what they know.They can give names,details,maybe places of where they might have lived or 
		  where there final resting place is.</p>
	<p><b>Surnames And Naming: </b>Although the spelling matters to us now, before the 20th century extraordinary variations regularly occur in different records ,
		   illiteracy was widespread and large numbers spoke Irish as their native language.Which means the names may have sometimes been miss-spelled correctly so when searching the records,you can use a search option to find
		   all abbreviations</p>
	<p><b>Dates: </b>Reported ages are almost never accurate. Before 1900, only a few very privileged children celebrated birthdays and without a celebration, 
	      Some people lied about their ages and never gave an exact age and rounded off to the nearest number.If you can try to put in a age range of what you thought your ancestor was at that time</p>
	<p><b>Record Everything : </b>The amount of information you’re dealing with can grow very quickly, especially in the early stages, 
	so it’s a good idea to decide at the outset on a way of storing information that makes it easy for you to find things quickly.Every little piece of information that you find write it down,it might not be very
	useful at that moment,you may be able to use it at a later stage.</p>
