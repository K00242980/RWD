	<p>Author: K00242980  Date:6th November 2019</p>
	<p>There are many records that you can have a look at to find out about your ancestors.Here are some of the most common records,
	<b>Applotment Books,Soldiers Wills,Birth, Birth,Marriage and Death Records,Griffiths Valuation Office books 1824-1856,
	   Will Registers 1858-1900,Records of the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen, 1860 – 1921.</b> I will have a deeper look into each one.</p>
	<p><b>Applotment Books :</b>The Tithe Applotment Books are the first in a series of National Archives records of genealogical interest to
	be digitised by the Genealogical Society of Utah in partnership with the National Archives, and placed online free to access.</p>
	<p><b>Soldiers Wills :</b>The Soldiers' Wills are an important historical record of the men who served, their social and economic background and 
	give valuable information on relatives and relationships. </p>
	<p><b>Birth,Marriage and Death Records :</b>It is very important to have these have these types of details as they help to put some of the pieces together,
	sometimes you may need to dates to start at the beginning.It can also help you to find more names of your records for example you would see the parents names 
	of the bride and groom on the marriage record.</p>
	<p><b>Griffiths Valuation Office books 1824-1856 :</b>These records were the first  printed volumes of the Primary (or Griffith's) Valuation, the record of Ireland's first comprehensive property tax, 
	have been available online for many years now, and are a crucial part of the genealogical infrastructure for the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
	<p><b>Will Registers 1858-1900 :</b>Almost all original Irish wills but unfortunately in the month of June 1922 there was a fire in the Public Record Office during the  Civil War. This was an unfortunate loss, as Wills are wonderful genealogical resources, 
	containing as they do many names not available elsewhere, as well as interesting details about people’s assets at death and family relationships</p>
	<p><b>Records of the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen, 1860 – 1921 :</b>
	These records consist of crew lists and agreements with seamen regarding wage rates, conditions of service and related information of ships, registered in what is now the Republic of Ireland between 1863 and 1921.
    These records were deposited in the National Archives in 1971 and 1978 by the Board of Trade in Britain.The shipping records contain much useful information not only for family and local history, but also for 
	maritime, social and economic history.</p>
