    <h2>What Is Genealogy?</h2>
	<img src="Books.png" alt="f1" id="f1"></a>
       <p>Genealogy is the study of family,origins and history. It is  an account of the descent of a person, family, or group from an ancestor or from older forms such as census records.
	    Genealogists compile lists of ancestors,which they arrange in pedigree of charts or other written forms.However, it has continuously been of interest and importance to people for hundreds of years. 
	    Those of noble birth in the European courts especially needed to know their lineage to determine who was actually in line for the crown.
		The term ‘Genealogy’ is the study of family ancestors with documentation of birth, marriage and death dates through parents, grandparents, great grandparents, as far back as possible.<a href="NewsArticles.html">Read More</a></p>
