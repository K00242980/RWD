    <h2>How To Search The Census Records </h2>
	<img src="News 3.jpg" alt="f1" id="f1"></a>
	<p>Author: K00242980  Date:4th November 2019</p>
	<p>	The National Archives was established on 1 June 1988 following the amalgamation of the State Paper Office (SPO) and the Public Record Office of Ireland (PROI).
        They also hold and secure the preservation of records of the Irish State and ensure appropriate arrangements for public access to archives.</p>
	<p><b>What Is It :</b>The 1901 and 1911 census site – www.census.nationalarchives.ie – is by far the best place to dip a toe in the water, it’s free, 
	intuitive and has images of all the original census forms.</p>
	<p><b>How To Search The Census Records :</b>You can search this site in two ways: by name of individual, or by location. Remember, the less information you put in, the more numerous the results.
		<b>Person search:</b>  Enter forename and surname of the individual you seek in the relevant boxes.
        Enter the county they lived in. If you know the townland or street where the person lived, enter that in the relevant box. If you know the person's age, enter that, and the search will cover that age plus or minus 5 years.
        You should also enter whether the person is Male or Female</p>
	<p><b>Surnames & Forenames : </b>If you are unsure of the spelling of the person's name, you can use wildcard characters. Use an asterisk (*) to represent letters of which you are not sure, eg M*Gee will bring up McGee &  MacGee.Names that begin with O as a prefix, like O'Brien, can be transcribed as O'Brien, O Brien or Obrien. Entering any of these will bring up all the variations.
		  Sometimes forenames were shortened or petnames used, eg Margaret/Maggie, Michael/Mick. Wildcards can be used in these cases.Use an asterisk (*) to represent letters of which you are not sure. 
		  For example, Cat*rine will bring up Catherine, Catharine.Sometimes people entered their entire name in either the surname or first name column, or transposed their names completely. 
		  If you are unsuccessful in your first search, try entering the person's surname in the first name box, and you may be lucky.</p>
	<p><b>Irish surnames & Forenames  : </b>Some people entered their name in the census in Irish, and in the old Gaelic script. These names have been listed in modern script, but not translated into English. 
	Usually, the name of the head of household is written on the back of the form in English.</p>
